# mqtt_as_timeout.py Implementation of a timeout on publication.

# (C) Copyright 2019 Kevin KÃ¶ck.
# Released under the MIT licence.

# This solution detects the case where a publication is delayed by lack of
# connectivity and cancels it if the delay exceeds a timeout.

# Note that it blocks other attempts at publication while waiting for a PUBACK,
# counter to the normal operation of the module. A solution capable of handling
# concurrent qos == 1 publications would require a set instance containing coros.

# It incorporates a workround for the bug in uasyncio V2 whereby cancellation
# is deferred if a task is waiting on a sleep command.
# For these reasons it was not included in the mqtt_as module.

# The occurrence of a timeout does not guarantee non-reception of the message:
# connectivity loss may occur between reception by the broker and reception of
# CONNACK by the client. However in this case the message would be received in
# a timely fashion.
