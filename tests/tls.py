# tls.py Test of asynchronous mqtt client with SSL for Pyboard D. Tested OK.

# This demo publishes to topic "result" and also subscribes to that topic.
# This demonstrates bidirectional TLS communication.
# You can also run the following on a PC to verify:
# mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -t result
# I haven't yet figured out how to get mosquitto_sub to use a secure connection.

# Public brokers https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/public_brokers

# red LED: ON == WiFi fail
# green LED heartbeat: demonstrates scheduler is running.
