# tls32.py Test of asynchronous mqtt client with SSL for ESP32. Fails with

# Please help me fix it.

# This demo publishes to topic "result" and also subscribes to that topic.
# This demonstrates bidirectional TLS communication.
# You can also run the following on a PC to verify:
# mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -t result
# I haven't yet figured out how to get mosquitto_sub to use a secure connection.

# red LED: ON == WiFi fail
