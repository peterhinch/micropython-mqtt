# The use of clean_session means that after a connection failure subscriptions
# must be renewed (MQTT spec 3.1.2.4). This is done by the connect handler.
# Note that publications issued during the outage will be missed. If this is
# an issue see unclean.py.

# red LED: ON == WiFi fail
# blue LED heartbeat: demonstrates scheduler is running.
